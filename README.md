This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to the use of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:`. When an object scheduled for a delayed invocation is deallocated before the invocation happens, attempting to send a message to the already-deallocated object results in a crash.  The example shows how this can occur and how to properly handle delayed selectors to avoid this issue.  The solution involves using techniques to ensure the object remains alive until the selector is executed.
