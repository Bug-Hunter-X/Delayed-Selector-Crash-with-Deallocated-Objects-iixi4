In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the misuse of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` when dealing with objects that might be deallocated before the selector is invoked.  If the object scheduled for a delayed invocation is released prematurely, attempting to invoke a selector on a deallocated object leads to a crash. This is subtle because the crash doesn't occur immediately, but after a delay.
